## General Information

Title: Effects of Prey Availability on Sarracenia Physiology at Harvard Forest 2005

Package ID: knb-lter-hfr.109.18

Creators: Ellison, Aaron and Farnsworth, Elizabeth

Abstract:

*Sarracenia* plants were studied to observe the effect of prey availability, looking at the variables amass, species, chlorophyll, sla, totmass, num_phylls, num_lvl, etc.

## Methodological Information

A manipulative feeding experiment was conducted at Harvard Forest using *Sarracenia* pitcher plants to investigate the correlation between morphological, physiological, and taxonomic variables. Each pitcher plant was assessed, and measurements of variables were taken. The experiment controlled prey availability while examining how the other variables responded to changes in prey availability.
